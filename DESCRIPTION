Description:
   Simulation of continuous-time discrete-state Markov chains, with an
   emphasis on simulation of clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints.
   The package simulates datasets and can summarize simulation results,
   reporting useful statistics such as hitting times.  This allows simulated
   time-to-event datasets to be produced, which can be useful in clinical
   trial design.
